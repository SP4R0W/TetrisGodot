### About
-------------
This is a project of mine I made in Godot 4 a few months ago. It's a remake of a Tetris clone I've made a few years ago in Solar2D.<br>
My aims were to make it look more appealing visually and make is less buggy, which I think I succeeded in. <br>

### Getting Started
-------------
To compile this project, you will need at least Godot v4.3. Do not forget you will need the required export templates. <br> 
More in-depth guide is avaiable here: https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/export/exporting_projects.html <br>
You're free to modify the project as you wish.
